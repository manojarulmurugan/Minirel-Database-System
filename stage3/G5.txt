Krishna Ramesh - kramesh5@wisc.edu
Manoj Arulmurugan - arulmurugan@wisc.edu
Scott Huddleston - schuddleston@wisc.edu

All three of us worked together to plan and draw out implementation. We also all constructed the allocBuf() method, discussing and analyzing the code as we worked.
Krishna wrote up the allocPage() method, and added comments.
Manoj wrote up the unpinPage() method, and added comments.
Scott wrote up the readPage() method, and added comments.
All three us then debugged together at the end.
